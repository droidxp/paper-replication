To assess the effectiveness of mining sandboxes created by each test case generation tools, we run these tools in benign apps and, based on resources sensitives access in this execution, we build their sandbox. Based on this sandbox, we investigate the capacity of detect malicious behaviors in the corresponding malign app. (Figure  \ref{fig:setup}) show all the experimental setup.
